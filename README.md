# ProjectABM - REMARK

This directory contains code to reproduce figures and tables of the paper [Equity Premium Puzzle, Expectations, and Covid-19: Evidence from Germany] by Adrian Monninger, and the LaTeX source to produce the paper once the figures have been created.

## Code 

Due to Data restrictions, figures and tables can only be produced locally with access to Data. 

##### Reproduce the figures and compile the paper locally using `nbreproduce`
   1. Install [nbreproduce](https://github.com/econ-ark/nbreproduce)
   2. Download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/BufferStockTheory` or a zip folder [using this link](https://github.com/econ-ark/BufferStockTheory/archive/master.zip).
   3. Execute `nbreproduce` from the command line.
	  
## Paper

The paper can be generated by compiling the LaTeX file `ProjectABM.tex` using a standard distribution of LaTeX like TeXLive or Overleaf.
