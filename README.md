# ProjectABM - REMARK

This directory contains code to reproduce figures and tables of the paper [Equity Premium Puzzle, Expectations, and Covid-19: Evidence from Germany] by Adrian Monninger, and the LaTeX source to produce the paper once the figures have been created.

## Code 

Due to Data restrictions, figures and tables can only be produced locally with access to Data. Nevertheless, stata codes for tables and python code for distribution estimations can be found in folder `Code`.

##### Reproduce the figures and compile the paper locally using `nbreproduce`
   1. Install [nbreproduce](https://github.com/econ-ark/nbreproduce)
   2. Download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/AMonninger/CompMethods2021-MonningerAB` or a zip folder [using this link](https://github.com/AMonninger/CompMethods2021-MonningerAB/archive/master.zip).
   3. Execute `nbreproduce` from the command line.
	  
## Paper

The paper can be generated by compiling the LaTeX file `ProjectABM.tex` using a standard distribution of LaTeX like TeXLive or Overleaf.
